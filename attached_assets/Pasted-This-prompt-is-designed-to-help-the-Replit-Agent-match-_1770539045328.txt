This prompt is designed to help the Replit Agent match the visual precision of your uploaded designs while implementing the specific "no-scroll" scroll-driven animation you described.

The Replit Agent "Visual & Technical Refinement" Prompt
Copy and paste this into your Replit chat to overhaul the design:

"Update the current project to match these exact design and behavioral specifications:

1. Layout & Scroll Behavior:

No Page Movement: The viewport must remain fixed. Hide the scrollbar entirely (overflow: hidden on body).

Scroll-Driven Animation: Use a virtual scroll listener (or an invisible tall div) so that scrolling down only progresses the animation. The webpage itself should not move.

Full Screen: The envelope and revealed letter must be centered and cover the full mobile screen (optimized for iPhone 11).

2. Visual Design (Matching References):

Envelope Appearance: Match 1000057433.png. Use a cream/off-white background. Include the red heart-shaped wax seal in the center.

Envelope Text: Above the seal, place 'the love you gave was never a waste.' in JimmyScript (or a similar cursive if unavailable). Below the seal, place 'LOVE, OLIVIA' in IBM Plex Mono.

Letter Appearance: Match 1000057434.png. The letter must have a thick red border. Inside, include a small red heart icon at the bottom.

Letter Text: Use the font Homemade Apple for the handwritten body text.

3. The Animation Sequence:

0-30% Scroll: The red heart seal fades out and the top flap opens smoothly.

30-100% Scroll: The letter slides out of the envelope and scales up to fill the screen elegantly.

Music: Ensure 'music.mp3' loops in the background, starting immediately upon the first scroll interaction.

4. Font Integration:

Import 'IBM Plex Mono' and 'Homemade Apple' from Google Fonts. If 'JimmyScript' isn't available, use 'Dancing Script' as a close substitute for the envelope text."

Implementation Tips for the Perfect "Apple" Feel
Font Check: Replit might struggle to find "JimmyScript" as it is often a premium font. If the Agent tells you it can't find it, ask it to use Dancing Script with a font-weight of 500—it mimics that elegant, loopy look perfectly.

The "No-Scroll" Trick: To make the animation feel high-end, the Agent should use a "virtual scroll" or deltaY listener. This ensures that even though the page isn't moving, the "inertia" of a finger swipe on an iPhone still makes the flap open with a natural weight.

Audio Loop: Ensure the Agent adds the loop attribute to your <audio> tag so the Laura Palmer theme doesn't cut out during a long read.
